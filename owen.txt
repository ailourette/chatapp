user account registration shouldn’t be using the pubsub, simple http server is enough, pubsub is for modules that are asynchronous (notification, chat, etc)

so you’d have 2 services: message queue consumer and http server

http server would have multiple endpoints e.g.
/account/create
/chat/send
whereas /chat/send would need to process asynchronously so inside the handler it would contain the producer
and /account/create would not need to process message asynchronously, so it would not contain the producer
